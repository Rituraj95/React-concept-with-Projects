# React Digital Clock Project

This React project is a simple digital clock that demonstrates fundamental concepts in React:

## Key Concepts

### 1. State Management with `useState`

The project uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the current time (`ctime`). The initial state is set to the current time, and it's updated at regular intervals.

### 2. Real-Time Updates with `setInterval`

To achieve real-time updates, the `setInterval` function is employed. It triggers the `updateTime` function every second, ensuring the displayed time is kept up-to-date.

### 3. Functional Component Implementation

The main component, `Gettime`, is implemented as a functional component, showcasing React's functional components and hooks.
