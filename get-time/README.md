  - The `setCtime` function is used to update the state.

- **Event Handling:**
  - The "Get time" button triggers the `updateTime` function through the `onClick` event, updating the displayed time.

- **Functional Components:**
  - The `GetTime` component is a functional component, highlighting the use of React hooks.
